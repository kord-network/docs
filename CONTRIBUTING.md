# Contribution Guide

The META protocol specifies how to connect data objects, data services, and datastores to create a persistent append-only shared data network. The protocol rewards actors in the network that serve, connect and process information, creating a shared global namespace for structured commercial metadata.

Firstly, thanks for wanting to help with the development of the META protocol. All contributions, code or documents, should come from a forked version of the respective repostitory. Then the proposed changes must be submitted via a pull request to the master branch. All pull requests must be reviewed by the maintainers of the repostitory in question. Once a pull request has been reviewed & approved; you should merge and rebase, and then delete the branch.
If you wish to submit more substantial changes or additions, please see the feature contributions section below.

##Â Git practice
Branches should be named with a brief semantic title.
Commit messages should follow these rules:
```
Short (50 chars or less) summary of changes

More detailed explanatory text, if necessary. Wrap it to about 72
characters or so. In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
subject of an email and the rest of the text as the body. The blank
line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit
the body entirely); tools like rebase can get confused if you run the
two together.

Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

 - Bullet points are okay, too

 - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, preceded by a
   single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions vary here

Issue: #1, #2
```

## Feature Contributions
For the submission of more substantial changes or additions, an issue should be opened outlining what is being proposed for implementation. The title of the issue should be descriptive and brief, follow the same rules as a commit message, as outlined above. The body of the issue should detail the reasoning for the need of the work to be carried out and the desired outcome.

## Code Formatting
_**Language specific formatting can be found in each repostitory.**_
